# The-Mini
The smallest - yet still fully functional - 3D printer I could design.    
Update: Very Close to functional. With school considered, the completion date is estimated to be end of October. 

Design goals:  
-Many smaller printers of this size used ROM drive steppers. I have oppted to exclude these as they have very limited accuracy (20steps/mm) compared to traditional Nema 14 based printers (80steps/mm).  
-An additional goal is for this printer to be able to achieve the same speed/accel of a default ender 3 (500mm/s2 and 50mm/s).  
-The entire printer (excluding filament and power supply) needs to fit into the 3x4x5 inch Vaultz lockbox I have.
